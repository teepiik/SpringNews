## Developement ideas
Due to shortage of time and programmers inexperience, there is still lot to do.
Next steps would be to add picture to news, several search opinions and registeration + login feature for users. Tests are almost non exists so good point to start with testing would be to test sites usage with Selenium and/or Cucumber. After these major improvements the next logical step would be to start fixing the appearance of the site. One way to go with the style could be with Bootstrap library. More and better validation for news creating could also be added, at this point there is only basic validation for headline, lead paragraph and news content body.
